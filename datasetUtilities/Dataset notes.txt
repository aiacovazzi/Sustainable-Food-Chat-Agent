Dataset notes:
problems on mapping compound ingredients or industrially processed ones

how many no match: 2397
how many wrong association (manually checked): 722

Category intorduced:
TOO_GENERIC mapping introduced, are ingredient for which the renaming procedure was destructive and should be redone
NOT_FOOD mapping introduced, are tools used in the preparation or simply error on processing text
NO_DATA maping introduced when no matchable information was found


Next steps:
	sweets for candy is not ok //fixed
	there is soluble coffe for coffee instant etc...
	re-check pasta and egg pasta
	re-check all vegetables typology (probably wfp is wrong)
	re-check all specific ingredients over the whole db (carbon cloud etc) //candy, candy bar, liqueur, vodka done

	Apply Assumption:
		remove frozen ingredient if not explicit
		remove heated in greenhouse if not explicit
		exotic fruit as imported by default

Then:
	self mapping on no match data
	analyze self mapped data and correct mistakes

	> a lot of mistakes! this because algorithm foud several spurious correlation between ingredients names
	
	still no matched data will left as that
	
	merge dataset
	

Vetables: take the greenhouse one or the open field one as standard?

Finally:
	import data and recompute sustainability score where ingredient covered are more than 80%
	
	computing:
		normalized cpf
		normalized wfp
		______________
		RecipeCarbonSustainabilityScore
		RecipeWaterSustainabilityScore
		
		RecipeSustainabilityScore = alpha*RecipeCarbonSustainabilityScore + beta*RecipeWaterSustainabilityScore
		
		This allow us to compute score even when an ingredient doesn't ave both informations
		
		Then normalized
	
	create clusters
	
	documentation


Future steps:
	Allergies
	
	Fix "should be fixed" ingredients
		
	TOO_GENERIC category should be fixed
	
	add information aboun locality
	
	compute weight of units

Recipe suggestion:
select by tipology ({tags: /main-dish/}), coverage, duration, absence of allergies, sustainable clusters, healty cluster, not presence in last 7 accpeted recipes, similar to the vector of tastes, eventually using the list of ingredient 

{ "$and": [ { "tags": { "$regex": "breakfast" } } ] }
{ "$and": [ { "tags": { "$regex": "snack" } } ] }
{ "$and": [ { "tags": { "$regex": "main-dish" } }, { "tags": { "$regex": "dinner" } } ] }
{ "$and": [ { "tags": { "$regex": "main-dish" } }, { "tags": { "$regex": "lunch" } } ] }

{"sustainability_score": {"$gte": 0.1, "$lte": 0.15}}
